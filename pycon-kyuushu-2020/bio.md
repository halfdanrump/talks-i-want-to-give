# Bio
Born in Denmark, living in Japan for 10 years. Currently working at Vuzz Inc where I'm doing a bit of everything, especially back-end development and DevOps work. I'm a long-time Python lover. I don't think I could live without Python! I'm Interested in data science and data visualization (I gave a talk about this at [Pycon JP 2017](https://pycon.jp/2017/ja/schedule/presentation/57/), distributed computing, async programming and much more. Two years ago I moved from Tokyo to Nara, and I would like to reconnect with the Python JP community. よろしくお願いします！
